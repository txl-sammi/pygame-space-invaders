# DecodED2 Game Project
 
Hello everyone! Welcome to the GitHub Repository for DecodED2, as a start you'll need to clone this repository and make sure you're in this current branch!

Next you'll need to make sure a couple of things are installed. (And by couple I mean like... two or three)

## Things To Install BeforeHand

First you'll want to ensure that you have Python 3.6/3.7/3.8/3.9 installed on your computer!

Next, ensure that you have pip installed to ensure you can download the necessary Python Libraries.

You'll want to install to Python Library **PyGame**. To do this, run the following command in your command line:

```python
pip install pygame
```

Lastly, you'll want an appropriate code editor to code. (Duh)

In which case, we recommend downloading Visual Studio Code for this project. You can check it out here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download 
 
And that should be it for now! See you in the first session! (**Starting on the 1st of September 2021**)
